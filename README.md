# yk-totp

`yk-totp` is a little CLI util for YubiKeys,
that will generate TOTP codes upon request.

The added benefit compared to [the official `ykman`][ykman] is that it offers
to store the password for unlocking your YubiKey in your system's keyring,
whereas `ykman` stores your password in it's config file.
(While the password is stored as `PBKDF2HMAC`-hash and not in plain-text,
this hash is all that is required to get to your 2FA
but this hash is not protected in anyway.)

This allows `yk-totp` to be used in other tools (like in an [Alfred Worflow][alred-wf])
which don't offer facilities to store or enter a password,
or where it's inconvenient to repeatedly enter the password.

## Requirements

This tool requires [_Python 3_][python] and an operating system that is supported by [the `keyring` Python module][keyring].

## Installation

For now, the way to install `yk-totp` is via PIP:

```bash
pip install yk-totp
```
